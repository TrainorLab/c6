To get deeplabcut running on my updated Win 10 machine, I had to install the following.

- nvidia 460 driver. The most recent for my GPU (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050), I believe.
- cuda 11.2
- cudnn 8
(including that crazy trick to manually copy-paste dlls by way of cudnn 11.3, https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/support-matrix/index.html#cudnn-versions-824)
- fresh anaconda, then made a dedicated environment DEEPLABCUT
- python 3.8
- tensorflow 2.6
- deeplabcut
